Whether you are a software developer or just someone who uses the Internet in your daily life, you’ve undoubtedly heard about Java. Its introduction was one of the most exciting developments in the history of the Web and Java applications have powered much of the growth of business on the Internet in the past 15 years. Java is, arguably, the most popular programming language in the world, used by millions of developers on almost every kind of computer imaginable. In the past decade, Java has surpassed languages such as C++ and Visual Basic in terms of developer demand and has become the de facto language for certain kinds of development—especially for web-based services. Most universities are now using Java in their introductory courses alongside the other important modern languages. </h3>

		<h2 class="text-center">Object-Oriented Programming using C++</h2>
		<h3 class="text-center">Object-Oriented Programming Using C++, Fourth Edition is designed for many levels of programming students and a variety of programming teaching styles. Readers who are new to programming will find the basics of programming logic and the C++ programming language covered thoroughly and clearly. Comprehensive, engaging explanations, multiple programming examples, and step-by-step programming lessons provide beginning readers with a solid C++ background. Users who know some C++ syntax, but are new to object-oriented programming, will find objects explored thoroughly from the first chapters. Objects are introduced early, so those who want to learn objects at the start of their programming experience can do so. Users who want to postpone objects can simply omit the later sections of each chapter and cover the basic programming structures with simple data types before returning to the more complex objects later on</h3>

		<h2 class="text-center">Learning JavaScript</h2>
		<h3 class="text-center">JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich, a developer at Netscape Communications Corporation, in 1995. Its initial development was very rapid, and much of the criticism leveled at JavaScript has cited the lack of planning foresight during its development. However, Brendan Eich was not a dabbler: he had a solid foundation in computer science, and incorporated remarkably sophisticated and prescient ideas into JavaScript. In many ways, it was ahead of its time, and it took 15 years for mainstream developers to catch on to the sophistication the language offered.</h3>
